Browsers get inputed a website address through the user interface, which then accesses the network that websites information is stored on. Then it takes the files from that network, most commonly html, css, and javascript files. Then the browser uses a rendering engine to display these files on the browser. Then a browser engine works with the rendering engine, the user interface, the browsers javascript interpreter, and the websites servers to allow for the functionality of a normal website.

I currently use google chrome for browsing the web.
